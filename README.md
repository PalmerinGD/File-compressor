# File compressor

## Description
This file compressor is a project specifically created for the course **"Analysis and design of algorithms"** at ESCOM. 
All the data structures used in the project were coded from scratch, so they are likely to have bugs.
- Priority queue
- Huffman tree

The implementation of the file compressor was based on Huffman coding, which was developed by David A. Huffman in 1952. If you want to learn more about Huffman coding check out the following [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding).

## Prerequisites
Verify you have install a C compiler.
If you are using Linux or Unix, gcc is installed by default.
All you need to do is open a terminal and type:
```
gcc -v
```
It will show the version of the compiler.

In case of Windows, you can install gcc by downloading the [installer](https://gcc.gnu.org/).

## Installation
